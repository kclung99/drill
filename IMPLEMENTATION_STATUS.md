# Implementation Status: localStorage-First Hybrid Tracking

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1-3)

### Database & Migrations
- ‚úÖ Created `supabase/migrations/001_tracking_tables.sql`
  - `habit_sessions` table with RLS policies
  - `chord_practice_sessions` table with RLS policies
  - Indexes for efficient queries

### Services & Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ `app/services/localStorageService.ts` - Centralized localStorage management
  - Habit data functions (backward compatible)
  - Chord session storage
  - Sync queue management
  - Migration flags

- ‚úÖ `app/services/supabaseSyncService.ts` - Background sync to Supabase
  - Queue habit sessions
  - Queue chord sessions
  - Batch upload to Supabase
  - Guest data migration
  - Error handling with retry

- ‚úÖ `app/hooks/useBackgroundSync.ts` - React hook for sync worker
  - Runs every 30 seconds
  - Only for logged-in users
  - Provides sync status

### Integration
- ‚úÖ Updated `app/utils/habitTracker.ts`
  - Uses new localStorage service
  - Queues sessions for Supabase sync

- ‚úÖ Updated `app/practice/page.tsx`
  - Saves detailed session metrics to localStorage
  - Queues chord sessions for Supabase sync
  - Calculates and stores: accuracy, times, attempts, per-chord data

- ‚úÖ Added `app/components/SyncProvider.tsx`
  - Wraps app to enable background sync
  - Added to layout.tsx

- ‚úÖ Updated `app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - Triggers guest data migration on first sign-in
  - Checks migration flag to prevent duplicates

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ‚úÖ Build passes with no errors
- ‚úÖ Proper type safety (no `any` types)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic imports to avoid circular dependencies

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
**Action Required:**
```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Manual via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy contents of supabase/migrations/001_tracking_tables.sql
# Run in SQL Editor
```

**Verify:**
- Tables `habit_sessions` and `chord_practice_sessions` exist
- RLS policies are active
- Indexes are created

---

### 2. Test Guest Mode (No Auth)
**Test Flow:**
1. Open app in incognito/private window
2. Complete a music practice session (3-5 chords)
3. Check localStorage:
   - `drill-habit-data` should have today's music session count
   - `drill-chord-sessions` should have detailed session data
   - `drill-sync-queue` should be empty (no user logged in)
4. Verify heatmap updates on home page

**Expected Behavior:**
- Everything works without auth
- No errors in console
- Instant UI updates

---

### 3. Test Logged-In Mode (With Auth)
**Test Flow:**
1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. Complete a music practice session
3. Check localStorage:
   - `drill-habit-data` updated
   - `drill-chord-sessions` updated
   - `drill-sync-queue` has 2 items (habit + chord session)
4. Wait 30 seconds (or force sync)
5. Check Supabase tables:
   - `habit_sessions` should have new row
   - `chord_practice_sessions` should have new row
6. Check localStorage:
   - `drill-sync-queue` should be cleared

**Expected Behavior:**
- Sessions save locally immediately
- Background sync uploads to Supabase
- No errors in console
- Sync queue clears after successful upload

---

### 4. Test Guest ‚Üí User Migration
**Test Flow:**
1. As guest, complete 2-3 practice sessions
2. Verify localStorage has data
3. Sign in with Google OAuth
4. Check console for "Migrating guest data to Supabase..."
5. Check Supabase tables - should have all guest sessions
6. Check localStorage:
   - `drill-migrated` should be 'true'
   - Original data still present

**Expected Behavior:**
- All guest data migrates to Supabase on first sign-in
- Migration happens once (flag prevents re-migration)
- Guest data remains in localStorage

---

### 5. Test Sync Retry on Failure
**Test Flow:**
1. Sign in
2. Turn off network (airplane mode)
3. Complete a practice session
4. Check `drill-sync-queue` - should have items
5. Turn network back on
6. Wait 30 seconds
7. Verify queue clears and data appears in Supabase

**Expected Behavior:**
- Queue persists across sessions
- Sync retries automatically when online
- No data loss

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Edge Cases

### 1. Concurrent Sessions on Multiple Devices
**Scenario:** User practices on laptop and phone simultaneously while offline

**Current Behavior:**
- Each device maintains its own localStorage
- When both sync, both sessions upload (append-only is safe)
- No conflicts, but no cross-device real-time sync

**Future Enhancement:**
- Implement `syncFromSupabase()` to pull remote sessions
- Merge remote data into localStorage on app load

### 2. localStorage Size Limits
**Current:** ~1.6 MB/user/year (well within 5-10MB browser limits)

**Monitor:**
- Very active users (10+ sessions/day)
- Consider cleanup of old sync queue items

### 3. Failed Migrations
**Scenario:** Migration fails mid-process

**Current Behavior:**
- Migration flag not set
- Will retry on next sign-in
- May cause duplicate uploads

**Future Enhancement:**
- Add transaction-like migration
- Better error recovery

## üìä Data Schema Reference

### localStorage Keys
- `drill-habit-data` - Habit session counters
- `drill-chord-sessions` - Detailed chord practice sessions
- `drill-sync-queue` - Pending Supabase uploads
- `drill-migrated` - Migration flag

### Supabase Tables
- `habit_sessions` - One row per completed session
- `chord_practice_sessions` - One row per practice session with full metrics

---

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Check localStorage
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Habit data:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('drill-habit-data')));
console.log('Chord sessions:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('drill-chord-sessions')));
console.log('Sync queue:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('drill-sync-queue')));
console.log('Migrated:', localStorage.getItem('drill-migrated'));
```

### Clear All Data (Reset)
```javascript
// In browser console
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('drill-')).forEach(k => localStorage.removeItem(k));
location.reload();
```

### Force Sync (Dev Tool)
```javascript
// In browser console
import('@/app/services/supabaseSyncService').then(async ({ syncToSupabase }) => {
  const result = await syncToSupabase();
  console.log('Sync result:', result);
});
```

## üìù Future Enhancements

### Phase 4: Multi-Device Sync (Optional)
- Implement `syncFromSupabase()` to pull remote data
- Merge strategy for conflicts (last-write-wins or union)
- Periodic background pull (every 5 minutes)

### Phase 5: Analytics Dashboard
- Show practice history graphs
- Accuracy trends over time
- Most difficult chord types
- Personal bests and achievements

### Phase 6: Drawing Session Analytics (Later)
- Create `drawing_practice_sessions` table
- Track per-image timing
- Category preference analysis
